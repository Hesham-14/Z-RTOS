# Z-RTOS-

## Description
I have developed my own Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) from scratch, designed to work with various processors/MCUs.<br />
The purpose of **ZRTOS** is to make the System capable of multitasking. It offers fundamental RTOS features.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Manage multiple tasks with different priorities.
- **Priority Based RTOS**: Highest Priority Task Runs First.
- **Round-Robin Support**: Support Round-Robin Scheduling when two or more tasks have the same highest priority.
- **sleep mode**: Executes a power-efficient function when the system goes into the IDLE state.
- **Context Switching**: Monitors and logs context switches with an optional hook function.
- **Mutex Support**: Provides a locking mechanism to ensure that resources are accessed mutually exclusively. Helpful for synchronization.
